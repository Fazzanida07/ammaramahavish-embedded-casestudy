# **Requirements**
## Introduction
Heated seats are powered by a heating element, a long strip of material that functions as a resistor. A resistor resists the flow of electricity. When electric current flows through it, the energy is turned into heat, which flows through the seat, warming the rider.

## Equipment
- Button sensor,heater sensor,microcontroller,LED

## SWOT Analysis
## Strength
1. Reduces heating cost.
2. Mobility.
3. Rapid heating and maintaining optimal temperature in the vehicle compartment over time.
4. Easy installation
## Weakness
1. It's only applicable for the countries which having lowest temperture
2. Excessive use not good.
## Opportunities
1. It can be installed easily. 
2. Boosts the value of car.
## Threats
1.Excessive use can cause various health issues.
